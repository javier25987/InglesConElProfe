# Presente continuo y pasado continuo


## Presente


Es el uso de el gerundio ing con la estructura de el presente simple por ejemplo

* I am eating
* my roommate is drinking
* she is coding
* it's not working
* they aren't updating the backend
* we aren't checking the code


> Para hacer una pregunta se cambia de posicion el verbo to be pero el vervo conjugado no



* are you estudying any programming language?
* is she debugging this code?


> Algunas consonantes se duplican con el uso de el gerundio pueden ser la t, s, n, d, g
>
> aveces se puede elinar la "e" en el final de algunos verbos ejm
>
> * win -> winning
> * get -> getting
> * begin -> beginning
> * dance -> dancing
> * code -> coding



en este timepo el verbo auxiliar es el mismo verbo to be, no es necesario la ayuda de el do y does en este tiempo verbal, y tal como el verbo to be las negaciones recaen sobre el
